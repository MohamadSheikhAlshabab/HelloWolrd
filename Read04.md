*  ## HTML5 Layout Element :
   - <"article"> , <"header"> ,<"section"> , <"hgroup"> , <"figure"> , <"figcaption"> , <"footer"> , <"nav">
    and <"aside"> all of these elements indicate for the contentÂ inside it.
    ex: <hgroup> ; to group together all of heading tags from H1 to H6 as one single group.
   - The new elements like (header or article , etc) are more clearer than multiple div elements.
   - Older browsers do not support _HTML5_ ,so we need to add more _JS_ code to support it.

* ## Process and Design :
  - Understand Clients' needs and what they expect to find in site.
  - Make site an attractive to attract and help clients to reach thier goals esaily.
  - Knowledge who is visit your site and whom you target ,also knowledge thier goals 
    and needs to achieved. 

* ## Structure :
  - Usage elements of _HTML_ to describe   how to seem a structure page.
  - Elements of _HTML_ are tags ,looklike a containers and content of tags indicate what shoule to do.
  - The tags should be consist from opening tag (consist less-than sign < , content then more-than sign >) 
    and closing tag (consist less-than sign < , Forward slash / ,content then more-than sign >).
  - In opening tag ,we add extra information about contents of element called **Attribute**.
  - Attribute consists two parts : a __name__ and a __value__ .
  
 * ## Extra Markup :
    - It should to put this word "DOCTYPE" in begin of every single web page to tell the browser
      whicch version of _HTML_ you use.
    - To add comments to clarify your code what you do ,by using these signs "<!-- Your comment here-->" also 
      your comment do not show up on web page but helps who see your source code to understand it.
    - Special characters like $ , & and @ etc.
    - <"div"> and <"span"> to group block-level and inline together.
    - <"meta"> support all info about web page.
