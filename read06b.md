# What is make computer , *A computer*?
- All computers to do these 4 things :
 1. INPUT.
 1. STORAGE.
 1. PROCESS.
 1. OUTPUT

## BIT :
 - Is a smallest unit of information can computer store ,it can be (1 or 0) only there is not third choice.

### Decimal and Binary systems:
 - **Decimal system** : consist numbers from 0 to 9.
 - **Binary system** : consist only 0 and 1.
 - So by using _binary system_ you can represent _decimal system_ but we need  more bits to do it ,Ex: by using 
   8 bits you can count from 0 until 255.
 - Pictures , images , videos and all graphics things made up from tiny dots called **pixel** .

#### Logic Circuits :
 - Simple circuit is "Not" and there are more like "AND" ,"OR" ,"NAND" ,"NOR" ,"XOR" and "XNOR".
   by using these simple circuits you can made complex ones (8 Bit-adder).
